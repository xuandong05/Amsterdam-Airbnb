# Amsterdam AirBnb Data Analysis

Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. The company is based in San Francisco, California, United States.

The company was conceived after its founders put an air mattress in their living room, effectively turning their apartment into a bed and breakfast, in order to offset the high cost of rent in San Francisco; Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

9. StandardScaler



## Motivation <a name="Motivation"></a>
As part of the projects of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project I am enrolled, I wanted to do some analysis that could be applied in the real world to help me making decisions.I was interested in analyzing 3 datasets of airbnb in Amsterdam since I love travelling and Amsterdam is the city where I stayed for 5 years to get my bachelor degree. After carefully looking into the data , here are the questions that I want to analyze:
1. What are the least busiest times of the year to visit Amsterdam?
2. Which locations are most inexpensive?
3. What are the main factors to affect the price of the rental properties?

In this project I am  going to use the CRISP - DM( Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) to answer the above questions.



## Files
3 datasets that Airbnb provides for Amsterdam will be used in this project: 
- listings.csv:Summary information and metrics for listings in Amsterdam.
- calendar.csv: Calendar Data for listings in Amsterdam. 
- reviews.csv: Summary Review data and Listing ID.

The original datasets are available at http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html
